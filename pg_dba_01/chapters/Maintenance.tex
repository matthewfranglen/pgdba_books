\chapter{Maintenance}
\label{cha:MAINTENANCE}\index{Maintenance}
The database maintenance is something crucial for keeping the data access efficient. Building a proper
maintenance plan is almost important like having a good disaster recovery plan.\newline

As seen in \ref{sec:MVCC} the update generates new tuple's version rather updating the affected field.
The new tuple is stored in the next available free space in the same page or a different one.
Frequent updates will in move the tuples across the data pages many and many times with a trail of dead
tuples. Unfortunately those tuples although consuming physically space, are no longer visible for the
new transactions and this results in the table bloat. The indices make things more complicated. When a new
tuple's version is stored in a different page the index entry needs update to point the new page. The the
index's ordered structure makes more difficult to find free space, resulting in an higher rate of new
pages added to the relation and consequent bloat. \newline

The following sections will explore the tools available for the relation's maintenance.

\section{VACUUM}\index{VACUUM}
\label{sec:VACUUM}
VACUUM is a PostgreSQL specific command which reclaims back the dead tuple's space. When executed without a
target table, the command scans all the tables in the database. A regular VACUUM have some beneficial
effects.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Removes the dead tuples and updates the free space map.
 \item Updates the visibility map improving the index only scans.
 \item It freezes the tuples with ageing XID preventing the XID wraparound\index{XID wraparound
failure}
\end{itemize}

The optional ANALYZE clause gathers the runtime statistics on processed table.\newline

When run VACUUM clear the space used by the dead rows making space for the inserts and updates inside the
data files. The data files are not shrunk except if there is a contiguous free space in the table's
end. VACUUM in this case runs a truncate scan which can fail if there is a conflicting lock with the
database activity. The VACUUM's truncate scan works only on the table's data files. The general approach
for VACUUM is to have the minimum the impact on the cluster's activity. However, because the pages are
rewritten, VACUUM can increase the I/O activity.\newline

The index pages are scanned as well and the dead tuples are also cleared. The VACUUM performances on the
indices are influenced by the maintenance\_work\_mem setting. If the table does not have indices VACUUM
will run the cleanup reading the pages sequentially. If there is any index VACUUM will store in the
maintenance work memory  the tuple's references for the subsequent index cleanup. If the memory is
not sufficient to fit all the tuples then VACUUM will stop the sequential read to execute the
partial cleanup on the indices and free the maintenance worm mem.\newline

The the maintenance\_work\_mem  can impact sensibly on the VACUUM's performance on large tables. For example
let's build build a simple table with 10 million rows.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# CREATE TABLE t_vacuum
        (
                i_id serial,
                ts_value timestamp with time zone DEFAULT clock_timestamp(),
                t_value text,
                CONSTRAINT pk_t_vacuum PRIMARY KEY  (i_id)
        )
;



CREATE TABLE


postgres=# INSERT INTO t_vacuum
        (t_value)
SELECT
         md5(i_cnt::text)
FROM
(
        SELECT
                generate_series(1,1000000) as i_cnt
) t_cnt
;
INSERT 0 1000000

CREATE INDEX idx_ts_value
        ON t_vacuum USING btree (ts_value);

CREATE INDEX

\end{lstlisting}
In order to have a static environment we'll disable the table's autovacuum. We'll also increase the
session's verbosity display what's happening during the VACUUM's run.\newline

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# ALTER TABLE t_vacuum
        SET
                (
                        autovacuum_enabled = false,
                        toast.autovacuum_enabled = false
                )
;
ALTER TABLE




\end{lstlisting}

We are now executing a complete table rewrite running an UPDATE without the WHERE condition.
This will create 10 millions of dead rows.\newline

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# UPDATE t_vacuum
        SET
                t_value = md5(clock_timestamp()::text)
;
UPDATE 1000000

\end{lstlisting}

Before running the VACUUM we'll change the maintenance\_work\_mem to a small value. We'll also enable the
query timing.\newline

VACUUM stores in the maintenance\_work\_mem an array of TCID pointers to the removed dead tuples. This
is used for the index cleanup. With a small maintenance\_work\_mem the array can consume the entire
memory causing VACUUM to pause the table scan for a partial index cleanup. The table scan then resumes.
Increasing the maintenance\_work\_mem to 2 GB\footnote{In order to have the table in the same conditions the
table was cleared with a VACUUM FULL and bloated with a new update.} the index scan without pauses
which improves the VACUUM's speed.\newline

Before proceeding let's put back the primary key and the index on the relation. We'll need it later.

\end{lstlisting}


The table seen in the example begins with a size of 806 MB . After the update the table's size is doubled.
After the VACUUM run the table does not shrink. This is caused because there is no contiguous free space in
the end. The new row versions generated by the update are stored in the table's end. A second UPDATE
with a new VACUUM could truncate the table if all the dead rows are in the table's end. However
VACUUM's main goal is to keep the table's size stable, rather shrinking down the space.\newline

The prevention of the XID wraparound failure managed automatically by VACUUM. When a live tuple have the
t\_xmin's older than the parameter vacuum\_freeze\_min\_age, then the t\_xid replaced with the
FrozenXID setting the tuple safely in the past. Because VACUUM by default skips the pages without dead
tuples some ageing tuples could be skipped by the run. The parameter vacuum\_freeze\_table\_age avoids
this scenario triggering a full table's VACUUM when table's relfrozenxid age exceeds the value.\newline

It's also possible to run VACUUM with the FREEZE \index{VACUUM FREEZE} clause. In this case VACUUM
will freeze all the tuples regardless of their age. The command is equivalent of running VACUUM with
vacuum\_freeze\_min\_age set to zero.\newline

VACUUM is controlled by some GUC parameters.

\subsection{vacuum\_freeze\_table\_age}
This parameter is used to start a full table VACUUM when the table's relfrozenxid exceeds the parameter's
value. The default setting is 150 million of transactions. Despite the possible values are between zero
and one billion, VACUUM will silently set the effective value to the 95\% of
the autovacuum\_freeze\_max\_age, reducing the possibility to have an anti-wraparound autovacuum.

\subsection{vacuum\_freeze\_min\_age}
The parameter sets minimum age for the tuple's t\_xmin to be frozen. The default is 50 million
transactions. The values accepted are between zero to one billion. However VACUUM will change silently the
effective value to one half of autovacuum\_freeze\_max\_age in order to maximise the time between the
forced autovacuum.

\subsection{vacuum\_multixact\_freeze\_table\_age}
From PostgreSQL 9.3 VACUUM maintains the multixact ID as well. This identifier is used to store the
row locks in the tuple's header.  Because the multixact ID\index{multixact ID} is a 32 bit quantity there
is the same XID's issue with the wraparound failure\index{multixact ID, wraparound failure}. This parameter
sets the value after that a table scan is performed. The setting is checked against the field relminmxid of
the pg\_class. The default is 150 million of multixacts. The accepted values are between zero and one
billion. VACUUM limits the effective value to the 95\% of autovacuum\_multixact\_freeze\_max\_age. This wat
the manual VACUUM has a chance to run before an anti-wraparound autovacuum.

\subsection{vacuum\_multixact\_freeze\_min\_age}
Sets the minimum age in multixacts for VACUUM to replace the multixact IDs with a newer transaction ID or
multixact ID, while scanning a table. The default is 5 million multixacts. The accepted values
are between zero and one billion. VACUUM will silently limit the effective value to one half of
autovacuum\_multixact\_freeze\_max\_age, in order to increase the time between the forced autovacuums.

\subsection{vacuum\_defer\_cleanup\_age}
This parameter have effect only on the master in the hot standby configurations. When set to a positive
value on the master, can reduce the risk of query conflicts on the standby. Does not have effect on a
standby server.

\subsection{vacuum\_cost\_delay}\label{sub:VACUUMCOST}
This parameter, if set to a not zero value enables the cost based vacuum delay\index{VACUUM, cost
based delay} and sets the sleep time, in milliseconds, for VACUUM process when the cost limit exceeds. The
default value is zero, which disables the cost-based vacuum delay feature.

\subsection{vacuum\_cost\_limit}
This parameter sets the arbitrary cost limit. VACUUM sleeps for the time set in vacuum\_cost\_delay when
the value is reached. The default value is 200.

\subsection{vacuum\_cost\_page\_hit}
The parameter sets the arbitrary cost for vacuuming one buffer found in the shared buffer cache. It
represents the cost to lock the buffer, look up to the shared hash table and scan the content of the page.
The default value is one.

\subsection{vacuum\_cost\_page\_miss}
This parameter sets the arbitrary cost for vacuuming a buffer not present in the shared buffer. This
represents the effort to lock the buffer pool, lookup the shared hash table, read the desired block
from the disk and scan its content. The default value is 10.

\subsection{vacuum\_cost\_page\_dirty}
This parameter sets the arbitrary cost charged when vacuum scans a previously dirty page\footnote{A
page is dirty when its modifications are not yet written on the relation's data file}. It represents the
extra I/O required to flush the dirty block out to disk. The default value is 20.

\section{ANALYZE}
\label{sec:ANALYZE}
The PostgreSQL's query optimiser builds the query execution plan using the cost estimates from the
internal runtime statistics. Each step in the execution plan gets an arbitrary cost used to compute the
plan total cost. The execution plan which estimated cost is lesser is then sent to the query executor.
Keeping the runtime statistics up to date helps the cluster to build efficient plans.\newline

The command ANALYZE\index{ANALYZE} gathers the relation's runtime statistics. When executed reads the
data, builds up the statistics and stores them into the pg\_statistics\index{pg\_statistics,
table} system table. The command accepts the optional clause VERBOSE to increase verbosity alongside the
optional target table and the eventual column list. If ANALYZE is launched with no parameters scans all the
tables in the database. Specifying the table name will cause ANALYZE to process all the table's
columns.\newline

When working on large tables ANALYZE runs a sample read on the table.  The GUC parameter
default\_statistics\_target determines the amount of entries read by the sample. The
default limit is 100. Increasing the value will cause the planner to get better estimates, in particular
for the columns with the data distributed irregularly. This accuracy have a cost. Will cause ANALYZE to
spend a longer time for the statistics gathering and building plus an bigger space required
in pg\_statistics.\newline


The following example will show how default\_statistics\_target can affects the estimates. We'll re use
the table created in \ref{sec:VACUUM}. This is the result of ANALYZE VERBOSE with the default
statistic target.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# SET default_statistics_target =100;
SET
postgres=# ANALYZE VERBOSE t_vacuum;
INFO:  analyzing "public.t_vacuum"
INFO:  "t_vacuum": scanned 30000 of 103093 pages, containing 2909979 live rows and 0 dead rows;
30000 rows in sample, 9999985 estimated total rows
ANALYZE
\end{lstlisting}

The table have 10 million rows but ANALYZE estimates the contents in just 2,909,979 rows, the 30\% of
the effective live tuples.\newline

Now we'll run ANALYZE with default\_statistics\_target set to its maximum allowed value, 10000.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
SET
postgres=# ANALYZE VERBOSE t_vacuum;
INFO:  analyzing "public.t_vacuum"
INFO:  "t_vacuum": scanned 103093 of 103093 pages, containing 10000000 live rows and 0 dead rows;
3000000 rows in sample, 10000000 estimated total rows
ANALYZE
\end{lstlisting}

This time the table's live tuples are estimated correctly in 10 millions.\newline

The table pg\_statistics is not intended for human reading. The statistics are translated in human
readable format by the view pg\_stats\index{pg\_stats, view}.\newline

The rule of thumb when dealing with poorly performing queries, is to check if statistics are recent
and accurate. The information is stored into the view pg\_stat\_all\_tables \footnote{The subset views
pg\_stat\_user\_tables and pg\_stat\_sys\_tables are useful to search respectively the current user and the
system tables only.}.

For example this query gets, for a certain table,  the last execution of the manual and the auto vacuum
alongside with the last analyze and auto analyze.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]

postgres=# \x
Expanded display is on.
postgres=# SELECT
        schemaname,
        relname,
        last_vacuum,
        last_autovacuum,
        last_analyze,
        last_autoanalyze
FROM
         pg_stat_all_tables
WHERE
        relname='t_vacuum'
;
-[ RECORD 1 ]----+------------------------------
schemaname       | public
relname          | t_vacuum

last_analyze     | 2014-06-17 18:48:56.359709+00
last_autoanalyze |

postgres=#



\end{lstlisting}


The statistics target is a per column setting allowing a fine grained tuning for the ANALYZE command.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]


--SET THE STATISTICS TO 1000 ON THE COLUMN i_id
ALTER TABLE t_vacuum
        ALTER COLUMN  i_id
                        SET STATISTICS 1000
;

\end{lstlisting}

The default statistic target can be changed for the current session only using the SET command. The cluster
wide value is changed using the parameter in the postgresql.conf file.

\section{REINDEX}\label{sec:REINDEX}
The general purpose B-tree index stores the indexed value alongside with the pointer to the
tuple's heap page. The index pages are organised in the form of a balanced tree linking each other
using page's special space seen in \ref{fig:INDEX01}. As long as the heap tuple remains in the same page
the index entry doesn't need update. The HOT strategy\index{HOT strategy} tries to achieve this goal keeping
the heap tuples in the same page. When a new tuple version is stored in the heap page then also the index
entry needs to reflect the change. By default the index pages have a percentage of space reserved for
the updates. This is an hardcoded 30\% for the not leaf pages and a 10\% for the leaf
pages. The latter can be changed adjusting the index's fillfactor.\newline

VACUUM efficiency is worse with the indices because their ordered nature. Even converting the dead
tuples to free space, this is reusable only if the new entry is compatible with the B-tree position.
The empty pages can be recycled but this requires at least two VACUUM runs. When an index page is empty
then is marked as deleted by VACUUM but not immediately recycled. The page is first stamped with the next
XID and therefore becomes invisible. Only a second VACUUM will clear the deleted pages returning the
free space to the relation. This behaviour is made on purpose, because there might be running
scans which still need to access the page. The second VACUUM is the safest way to recycle the page only
if no longer required.\newline

Therefore the indices are affected by the data bloat more than the tables. Alongside with a bigger disk
space allocation, the bloat results generally in bad index's performances. The periodical reindex
is the best way to keep the indices in good shape.\newline

Unlike the VACUUM, the REINDEX have a noticeable impact on the cluster's activity. To ensure the data is
consistently read the REINDEX sets a lock on the table preventing the table's writes. The reads are also
blocked for the queries which are using the index.\newline

A B-tree index build requires a the data to be sorted. PostgreSQL comes with a handy GUC parameter to track
the sort, the trace\_sort\index{trace\_sort} which requires a verbosity set to DEBUG.

The following example is the output of the primary key's reindex of the test table created in
\ref{sec:VACUUM}.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]

\end{lstlisting}

The reindex performs a data sort but maintenance\_work\_mem does not fit the table's data. PostgreSQL
then starts a disk sort in order to build up the index. The way PostgreSQL determines whether sort
on disk or in memory should use follow this simple rule. If after the table scan the maintenance work
memory is exhausted then will be used a sort on disk. That's the reason why increasing the
maintenance\_work\_mem  can improve the reindex. Determining the correct value for this parameter is
quite tricky.\newline
This is the reindex using 1 GB for the maintenance\_work\_mem.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# \timing

postgres=# SET maintenance_work_mem='1GB';

\end{lstlisting}

After the sort the reindex creates a new index file from the sorted data which is changed in the system
catalogue's pg\_class.relfilenode. When the reindex's transaction commits the old file node is deleted. The
sequence can be emulated creating a new index with a different name. The old index can be dropped safely
and the new one renamed to the old's name. This approach have the advantage of not blocking the
table's reads using the old index.\newline

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]

postgres=# CREATE INDEX idx_ts_value_new
                ON t_vacuum USING btree (ts_value);
CREATE INDEX

postgres=# DROP INDEX idx_ts_value;
DROP INDEX
postgres=# ALTER INDEX idx_ts_value_new
                RENAME TO idx_ts_value;
ALTER INDEX

\end{lstlisting}



From the version 8.2 PostgreSQL supports the CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY statement\index{CREATE INDEX
CONCURRENTLY} which doesn't block the cluster's activity. With this method  the index creation
adds a new invalid index in the system catalogue then starts a table scan to build the dirty index. A
second table scan is then executed to fix the invalid index entries and, after a final validation
the index becomes valid. \newline

The concurrent index build have indeed some caveats and limitations.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Any problem with the table scan will fail the command and leaving an invalid index in place.
This relation is not used for the reads but adds an extra overhead to the inserts and updates.
\item When building an unique index concurrently this start enforcing the uniqueness when the
second table scan starts. Some transactions could then start reporting the uniqueness violation
before the index becoming available. In the case the build fails on the second table scan the invalid
index will enforce the uniqueness regardless of its status.
\item Regular index builds can run in parallel on the same table. Concurrent index builds cannot.
\item Concurrent index builds cannot run within a transaction block.
\end{itemize}

The primary keys and unique constraints can be swapped like the indices using a different
approach. PostgreSQL since the version 9.1 supports the \textit{ALTER TABLE table\_name
ADD table\_constraint using\_index} statement. Combining a DROP CONSTRAINT with this command is possible
to swap the constraint's index without losing the uniqueness enforcement.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
postgres=# CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pk_t_vacuum_new
                ON  t_vacuum USING BTREE (i_id);
CREATE INDEX
postgres=# ALTER TABLE t_vacuum
                DROP CONSTRAINT pk_t_vacuum,
                ADD CONSTRAINT pk_t_vacuum_new PRIMARY KEY
                        USING INDEX pk_t_vacuum_new
           ;
ALTER TABLE
postgres=# ALTER INDEX pk_t_vacuum_new
                RENAME TO pk_t_vacuum;
ALTER INDEX

\end{lstlisting}

The example uses a regular index build and then blocks the writes. It's also possible to
build the new index concurrently.

This method cannot be used though if any foreign key references the local key.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pgsql]
 postgres=# CREATE TABLE t_vac_foreign
                                        (
                                                i_foreign serial,
                                                i_id integer NOT NULL,
                                                t_value text
                                        )
            ;
CREATE TABLE
postgres=# ALTER TABLE t_vac_foreign
                ADD CONSTRAINT fk_t_vac_foreign_t_vacuum_i_id
                        FOREIGN KEY (i_id)
                        REFERENCES t_vacuum (i_id)
                        ON DELETE CASCADE
                        ON UPDATE RESTRICT;
ALTER TABLE

postgres=# CREATE UNIQUE INDEX pk_t_vacuum_new ON  t_vacuum USING BTREE (i_id);
CREATE INDEX
postgres=# ALTER TABLE t_vacuum
postgres-# DROP CONSTRAINT pk_t_vacuum,
postgres-# ADD CONSTRAINT pk_t_vacuum_new PRIMARY KEY  USING INDEX pk_t_vacuum_new;
ERROR:  cannot drop constraint pk_t_vacuum on table t_vacuum because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  constraint fk_t_vac_foreign_t_vacuum_i_id on table t_vac_foreign depends on index
pk_t_vacuum
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.


\end{lstlisting}

In this case the safest way to proceed is to run a conventional REINDEX.


\section{VACUUM FULL and CLUSTER}\index{VACUUM FULL}\index{CLUSTER}
\label{sec:VACFULL}
PostgreSQL ships with two commands used to shrink the data files.\newline

The command CLUSTER can be quite confusing. It's purpose is to rebuild a completely new table with
the tuples with same order of the clustered index which is set using  the  command
\textit{ALTER TABLE table\_name CLUSTER ON index\_name}.\newline

For example, this is the verbose output of the cluster command for the table created in \ref{sec:VACUUM}.
The table has been clustered on the timestamp field's index.

\end{lstlisting}

CLUSTER have different strategies to order the data. In this example the chosen strategy is the sequential
scan and sort strategy. The tuples are stored into a new file node which is assigned to the
relation's relfilenode. Before completing the operation the indices are reindexed. When the CLUSTER is done
the old file node is removed from the disk. The process is quite invasive though. Because the
relation is literally rebuilt from scratch it requires an exclusive access lock which blocks the reads and
the writes. The storage is another critical point. There should be enough to keep old relation's data
files, with the new files plus the indices and the eventual sort on disk.\newline

Taking a look to source code in \textbf{src/backend/commands/cluster.c}, show us how CLUSTER and VACUUM
FULL do the same job with a slight difference. VACUUM FULL does not sort the new relation's data..\newline

VACUUM FULL and CLUSTER have some beneficial effects on the disk storage as the space is returned to the
operating system and improve the indices performance because the implicit reindex.\newline

The blocking nature of those commands have an unavoidable impact on the cluster's activity. Unlike the
conventional VACUUM, CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL should run when the cluster is not in use or in a maintenance
window. CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL do not fix the XID wraparound failure.\newline

As rule of thumb, in order to minimise the database's downtime, CLUSTER and VACUUM FULL should be used only
for the extraordinary maintenance and only if the disk space is critical.



\section{The autovacuum}\index{AUTOVACUUM}
\label{sec:AUTOVACUUM}
The autovacuum daemon was introduced in the revolutionary PostgreSQL 8.0. From the version 8.3 was enabled
by default because reliable and efficient. With autovacuum turned on the maintenance and the statistic
gathering is done automatically by the cluster. Turning off autovacuum it doesn't disable completely the
daemon. Actually the workers are started automatically to prevent the XID and multixact ID wraparound
failure, regardless of the setting. In order to have autovacuum working the statistic collector must be
enabled with track\_counts= 'on'.\newline

The following parameters control the autovacuum behaviour.

\subsection{autovacuum}
This parameter is used to enable or disable the autovacuum daemon. Changing the setting requires
the cluster's restart.

\subsection{autovacuum\_max\_workers}
The parameter sets the maximum number of autovacuum subprocesses. Changing the setting requires the
cluster's restart. Each subprocess consumes one PostgreSQL connection.

\subsection{autovacuum\_naptime}
The parameter sets the delay between two autovacuum runs on a specified database.The delay is
measured in seconds and the default value is 1 minute.

\subsection{autovacuum\_vacuum\_scale\_factor}
The parameter one specifies the fraction of the relation's live tuples to add to the set in value in
autovacuum\_vacuum\_threshold in order to determine whether start the automatic VACUUM. The default is 0.2,
which is the table's 20\%. This setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing the storage
parameters.

\subsection{autovacuum\_vacuum\_threshold}
This parameter sets the extra threshold of updated or deleted tuples to add to the value determined
from autovacuum\_vacuum\_scale\_factor. The value is used to trigger an automatic VACUUM. The default is 50
tuples. This setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing the storage parameters. For
example a table with 10 million rows and autovacuum\_vacuum\_threshold, autovacuum\_vacuum\_scale\_factor
set both to their default values, the autovacuum will start after when 2,000,050 tuples are updated or
deleted.

\subsection{autovacuum\_analyze\_scale\_factor}
The parameter specifies the fraction of table to add to autovacuum\_analyze\_threshold in order to determine
whether start the automatic ANALYZE. The default is 0.1, which is the table's 10\%. This setting can be
overridden for individual tables by changing storage parameters.

\subsection{autovacuum\_analyze\_threshold}
This parameter sets the extra threshold of updated or deleted tuples to add to the value determined from
autovacuum\_analyze\_scale\_factor. The value is used to  trigger an automatic ANALYZE. The default is 50
tuples. This setting can be overridden for individual tables by changing the storage parameters. For
example a
table with 10 million rows and autovacuum\_analyze\_scale\_factor, autovacuum\_analyze\_threshold set both
to their default values will start an automatic ANALYZE when 1,000,050 tuples are updated or deleted.

\subsection{autovacuum\_freeze\_max\_age}
The parameter sets the maximum age for the pg\_class's relfrozenxid. When the value is exceeded then an
automatic VACUUM is forced on the relation to prevent the XID wraparound. The process will start
even if the autovacuum is turned off. The parameter can be set only at server's start but is possible to
set the value per table by changing the storage parameters.

\subsection{autovacuum\_multixact\_freeze\_max\_age}
The parameter sets the maximum age of the table's pg\_class's relminmxid. When the value is exceeded then
an automatic VACUUM is forced on the relation to prevent the  multixact ID wraparound. The process will
start even if the autovacuum is turned off. The parameter can be set only at server's start but is possible
to set the value per table by changing the storage parameters.

\subsection{autovacuum\_vacuum\_cost\_delay}
The parameter sets the cost delay to use in the automatic VACUUM operations. If set to -1, the regular
vacuum\_cost\_delay value will be used. The default value is 20 milliseconds.

\subsection{autovacuum\_vacuum\_cost\_limit}
The parameter sets  cost limit value to be used in the automatic VACUUM operations. If set to -1 then the
regular vacuum\_cost\_limit value will be used. The default value is -1. The value is distributed among the
running autovacuum workers. The sum of the limits of each worker never exceeds this variable. More
information on cost based vacuum here \ref{sub:VACUUMCOST}.
